## Flow

To make the whole project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/parksw3/asymptomaticvariant.git
cd asymptomaticvariant
make Makefile
make pullall
make main.pdf
```

## Organization

Everything is in the main directory.

outputs/ is for copies of target files that we want to push (so that we don't need to put revision control on active targets)
